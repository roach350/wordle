# wordle
A wordle clone for GLUT

```
Word List grabbed from https://gist.githubusercontent.com/dracos/dd0668f281e685bad51479e5acaadb93/raw/6bfa15d263d6d5b63840a8e5b64e04b382fdb079/valid-wordle-words.txt on 07-18-2024



As the name suggest, this is just another Wordle clone, but I never finished it. The only useful thing here are the font files. I may come back to this project in the future, but here it is for now.
*UPDATE*
I did come back to the project and finally developed it to a point where it is now a "functional" game. There is still plenty of polishing that needs to be done.
